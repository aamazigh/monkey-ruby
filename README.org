* Monkey Ruby
  An interpreter for the [[https://interpreterbook.com/index.html#the-monkey-programming-language][Monkey]] Programming Language written in Ruby.
  It is based on the book [[https://interpreterbook.com/][Writing An Interpreter in Go.]]

The code contains a lexer, a recusive descent parser (Pratt parser) that generates an Absract Syntax Tree, an evaluator and a REPL.  

No external dependencies were used in writing the interpreter, except for the Ruby unit testing framework [[https://github.com/minitest/minitest][minitest]]. 

** Running the REPL 
First, install ruby on your machine. 

To launch the REPL:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
./bin/rbmonkey

Welcome to the ruby implementation of the Monkey programming language!
>> 
#+END_SRC

Testing function closures:

#+BEGIN_SRC 
Welcome to the ruby implementation of the Monkey programming language!
>> let newAdder = fn(a, b) { fn(c) { a + b + c}; };
fn(a, b) {
fn(c){ ((a + b) + c) }
}

>> let adder = newAdder(1, 2);
fn(c) {
((a + b) + c)
}

>> adder(8) 
11
#+END_SRC
