* Monkey Ruby
  An interpreter for the [[https://interpreterbook.com/index.html#the-monkey-programming-language][Monkey]] Programming Language written in Ruby.
  It is based on the book [[https://interpreterbook.com/][Writing An Interpreter in Go.]]

The code contains a lexer, a recusive descent parser (Pratt parser) that generates an Absract Syntax Tree, and a REPL.  

No external dependencies were used in writing the interpreter, except for the Ruby unit testing framework [[https://github.com/minitest/minitest][minitest]].
